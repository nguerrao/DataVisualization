## Abstract

The goal of our project is to give a better understanding of Co2 emissions and how it impacts the climate. Tackling this problem has become a priority, and the young generation is taking actions through activism, entrepreneurship or in politics. However, some facts about global Co2 emissions are still not known, and might sometimes be unclear. Experts often use different metrics, and their reports can be hard to follow.

As as result, we give an easily understandable overview of the various emissions, and hope to educate the users of our website with different interactions.

First, we show the global situations of Co2 emissions and then we dive into each contributing sector individually (Energy, Industry, Agriculture, and finally Transportation).

## Project Structure
Our project is structured as follows:

```       
├───JS               (Our javascript files)
├───imgs             (Images used in the website)
├───milestones       (Milestones)
├───data             (Data used in visualizations)
├───lib              (Libraries)
├───index.html       (Webpage)
├───style.css        (Styling) 
```

## Data

For each visualization on our website we have a different data source. 

**Global Overview:** [Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions?historical-emissions-data-sources=71&historical-emissions-gases=246&historical-emissions-regions=All%20Selected&historical-emissions-sectors=843&page=3#data)  
**Energy:** [Electricity source by country](https://github.com/owid/energy-data)  
**Industry:** [Industry emissions by material](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00690-8#MOESM3)  
**Agriculture:** [Food Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local)  
**Transport:** [Transporation emissions](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/transport-sector-co2-emissions-by-mode-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2000-2030)
